# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent release receives security fixes, regardless of version number. Older releases, including older major versions, are not backported.

| Version        | Supported          |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Latest release | yes                |
| Anything older | no                 |

If you need a fix and you are on an older release, upgrade to the latest release first.

This policy assumes a solo maintainer, which is the normal setup for these projects. If a project grows into a team effort with users who genuinely need multiple supported release lines, this file can be adapted to add a longer support window instead.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue in this project, please do not file a public GitHub issue.

Instead, open a private GitHub Security Advisory:
- Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/Kinsman4249/simple-multi-snake/security) of this repository.
- Click "Report a vulnerability".
- Provide as much detail as possible: affected version, reproduction steps, impact, and any suggested mitigation.

You should receive an acknowledgment within a few business days. If the issue is confirmed, a fix will be developed privately and released as a patch version. You will be credited in the release notes, or anonymously if you prefer.

## Scope

In-scope:
